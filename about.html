            <h3>Founder: Sheikh Hassan Ali Cisse (RA) (1945-2008)</h3>
            <p>
              Sheikh Hassan Ali Cisse was a distinguished Islamic scholar,
              humanitarian, and the revered Founder and Chairman of the African
              American Islamic Institute (AAII) from its inception in 1988 until
              his passing in 2008. As the grandson and spiritual heir of the
              renowned Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse, he was designated Imam of the
              Grand Mosque in Medina-Baye, Kaolack, Senegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hailing from the Cisse lineage, one of West Africa's most ancient
              scholarly families tracing back over a millennium, Sheikh Hassan
              received a comprehensive traditional Islamic education. He
              memorized the Holy Qur'an at a young age and studied Islamic
              sciences like Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh, and Tasawwuf under Shaykh
              Ibrahim Niasse and his father, Sidi Ali Cisse. His academic
              pursuits included a B.A. from Ain Shams University in Cairo and an
              M.A. in English from the University of London.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sheikh Hassan Cisse was a preeminent international spokesman for
              the Tariqa Tijaniyya. He introduced the Tijaniyya to America in
              1976 and dedicated his life to spreading authentic Islamic
              knowledge, promoting moderation, women's rights, and fostering
              cultural exchange, particularly through AAII. His humanitarian
              efforts earned recognition from organizations like the UN and WHO.
              He continued his grandfather's mission, guiding Muslims worldwide
              and emphasizing adherence to Allah's commands.

            <h3>Director of the Online Courses: Munir Cisse</h3>
            <p>
              Munir Cisse is a passionate educator and leader who blends deep
              Islamic scholarship with a modern, global outlook. The son of the
              respected Imam Hassan Cisse, Munir continues his family's legacy
              of spiritual leadership and community service with humility and
              heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              He studied theology at the renowned Al-Azhar University in Egypt,
              and his academic journey also took him through Senegal and
              Mauritania. With a strong foundation in classical Islamic
              teachings, Munir is fluent in Classical and Modern Standard
              Arabic, and also speaks some English and French—skills that help
              him connect with diverse communities around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              From 2018 to 2022, Munir served as President of Ansar al-Din, an
              international Sufi student network active in over 30 countries. He
              led impactful programs including seminars, heritage events, and
              publications on Tijani teachings. He's also a gifted speaker,
              often invited to talk about the life of Prophet Muhammad (peace be
              upon him) and historical figures like Shaykh Ibrahim Niasse—always
              drawing meaningful links between faith and the challenges of our
              times.
            </p>
            <p>
              At home in Senegal, Munir stays deeply engaged with local
              communities. He is active in grassroots projects that provide food,
              education, and healthcare in Medina Baye, keeping alive the
              mission of compassion and service his father championed.
